## Anirudh Kumar

Hello! My name is Anirudh, and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Washington.

I have been immersed in the world of STEM since sixth grade, and I can't wait to grow my passions further.

Currently, I am learning some computer graphics concepts on my own time and hope to get into some Arduino programming too.

Apart from programming, I train in Karate, \[ocassionally\] practice my violin, play video games, and go on hiking and camping trips with my family. I also love trivia: I am a huge _Jeopardy!_ fan and aspire to be a contestant on the show one day.
